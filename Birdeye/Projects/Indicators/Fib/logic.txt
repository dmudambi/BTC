Logic Flow for the Fibonacci Strategy

1. Import Required Libraries and Data
   - Use libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for calculations, and matplotlib for visualizations.
   - Load the historical data for the trading pair you are interested in (e.g., CSV, API). The data should contain time, open, high, low, and close prices.

2. Define Parameters
   - Set the timeframes (e.g., 5m, 15m, 1h).
   - Set Fibonacci levels: 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, and 0.786.
   - Specify the range and adjustment values for each level:
     - 0.382: Range ±5
     - 0.5: Range ±10
     - 0.618: Range ±15
     - 0.786: Range ±20

3. Calculate Fibonacci Prices
   - Identify the all-time high (ATH) up to the current point in time.
   - Calculate the target Fibonacci prices using the formula:
     FibPrice = ATH * (1 - FibLevel)
   - Adjust the ranges based on the Fibonacci levels:
     FibPriceRange = FibPrice ± Range

4. Iterate Through Candles
   - Start the iteration with each candle in the selected timeframe.
   - For each candle Ci, check if the close price is at or below the current Fibonacci level:
     - If Ci.close <= FibPrice, proceed to the next step.
     - If not, continue to the next candle.

5. Load Smaller Timeframe Data
   - If a signal is detected on the higher timeframe (e.g., 5m), load the smaller timeframe data (e.g., 1m).
   - Filter this data to focus on the period after the initial signal.

6. Updated Entry Conditions
   - Set the entry condition candle for the smaller timeframe with the same time value as the candle that crossed below the FibPrice. Call this Entry condition candle at time i as ECi where ECi = Ci for the smaller timeframe T.
   - While the close of ECi remains within the Fibonacci price range (FibPriceRange), perform the following:
       - Move to the next candle in the smaller timeframe (Ci = Ci + 1).
       - Check if either (Ci(high) - Ci(open)) or (Ci(close) - Ci(open)) is greater than 1.03 * (ECi(high) - ECi(open)).
       - If true, set the buy price as 1.03 * (ECi(high) - ECi(open)) and place a buy order at the calculated buy price.

7. Exit Conditions
   - The exit condition will trigger when the current candle's high (Ci(high)) or close (Ci(close)) reaches the predefined take profit or stop loss level.
   - Adjust the stop loss dynamically (e.g., trailing stop) if the trade moves favorably.

8. Log Trades and Results
   - Record each trade’s entry and exit details, including timestamp, buy price, and exit price.
   - Calculate performance metrics (e.g., profit/loss, win rate, risk-reward ratio).

9. Visualization
   - Plot the price action with marked Fibonacci levels.
   - Highlight entry and exit points.
